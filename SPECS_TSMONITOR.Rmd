## Introduction

This is a brief documentation and user manual for the TSMONITOR Shiny App. It explains what the App functionalities are and also what is happening under the hood. Where appropriate references to the relevant bibliography will be given.

As the App is further developed and fine-tuned this document will give an account of the upgrades and changes.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is an interesting article about data analysis [@smith2020].
